Senio builds immersive workout video games that use head tracking and motion sensing.

	1. The sensor
		Sensor continously streams data to your device. Our algorithms synthesize the information
		and transform it into input for the game that you are playing.

	2. The camera
		The camera uses head tracking similar to kinect. It tracks how close you are, how fast you move etc.

	================

	The game

		After picking up data from the sensor and parsing it, your video game hero moves as fast as you 
		move. In the case of rowing arms, and in the case of cycling ankles. Then, when you see obstacles,
		you can move your player to the left and right/
